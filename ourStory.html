            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                A wise man, Frankie Ballard, sings that, "...it all started with an ice cold beer."  For us, that statement rings very true.  Having met on October 27, 2015 at Tap House Bar and Grill, we started to get to know one another in person and our personal tastes in beer.  Fast forward 2 years later and we now brew our own beer under the name "M T Bottle Brewing."

                Besides brewing, our love for dogs, running, being active, and traveling are just a few things we share.  Having visited Asheville and Raleigh, NC; an eleven-hundred mile West Coast road trip; and ski trips in Wisconsin and Breckenridge, CO, we are looking forward to expanding our worldview together!
